### Analysis of Optimization Algorithms

Deep Q-Network(DQN) is one of the early deep reinforcement learning methods proposed by DeepMind which combines reinforcement learning with a class of artificial neural networks to approximate a state-value function in a Q-learning framework. It used a Convoluted Neural Network architecture as a function approximator. Progressive and commonly used optimization algorithms are benchmark to analyse the challenges and advantages to learn control agents to maximize returns. OpenAI gym environments are used to create the control agents and the optimization algorithms were implemented for Back-Propagation in DQN model. This project is to study the performance of different optimization algorithms on these control agents.
